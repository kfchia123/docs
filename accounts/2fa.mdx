title: "How do I enable 2FA for my account?"
---

Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) enhances security by adding a second step to the login process.\
It combines something that you know (for example, your password) with a second factor from an app from your phone.\
Requiring both to log in decreases the threat of a leaked password.

To enable 2FA, first you need to already have or to install a **Time-Based Tokens** app on your phone.\
The common app is **Google Authenticator**, available for both Apple iOS or Android phones.\
\
With **Time-Based Tokens**, you enter a 6-digit code that regenerates every 30 seconds in addition to your regular username and password.\
Only your token device will have your secret key and be able to generate valid one-time passwords for your account.

**Enabling 2FA in your account**

You can configure can 2FA in theÂ [**<u>Account Manager Portal</u>**](https://my.cloudbud.com/) at top right corner where your name is shown, click on it.

Select **Security Settings**

You can see the current status of your 2FA. Click on **Click Here to Enable**

At the next screen, click on **Get Started** to start the configuration process.

After following the instructions and completed the setup, you just need to open the app and get the current time based token code when you are logging into our [**<u>Account Manager Portal</u>**](https://my.cloudbud.com/).

PS. During the above configuration, you will be given a backup code towards the end of process. Remember to keep the code in a safe place.
