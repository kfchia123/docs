These terms of use (the “Terms”) are a legal contract between CloudBud, a trading name of BYIO Singapore Pte. Ltd., and “you” (“Customer,” “your,” or “User”). The Terms explain how you are permitted to use the services provided by and through our platform and website(s) (main url located at [cloudbud.com](http://cloudbud.com)) as well as all of our associated internet and online properties (either linked by CloudBud and/or affiliated companies) and any software that CloudBud provides to you for download or use, including in your mobile devices (collectively, our “App(s)”) (all of these virtual properties, software and mobile applications, collectively, the “Site”). These Terms also govern your use of all the text, data, information, software, graphics, proprietary content, and more (all of which we refer to as “Materials”) that we and/or our affiliates may make available to you, as well as any services we may provide through this Site). Collectively, the Site, the Materials, and the services provided therein are referred to as the “Services.”

# **Contractual Relationship**

By using the Services, you represent and warrant that you are of age under the laws of your jurisdiction and/or lawfully able to enter into contracts. If you are not legally able to enter into contracts, you may not use the Services at any time or in any manner or submit any information to CloudBud or the Services.

If you enter these Terms on behalf of a business entity or organization, you represent and warrant that you have the legal authority and capacity to bind such a business entity or organization. If you are not authorized nor deemed by law to have such authority, you assume sole personal liability for the obligations set out in these Terms.

# **Privacy**

Please review our privacy policy (the “Privacy Policy”) which explains how we use the information you submit to CloudBud. The Privacy Policy is hereby incorporated by reference.

# **Modifications**

(a) These Terms. CloudBud can change, update, add, or remove provisions of these Terms at any time by posting the updated Terms on the Site and by providing a notice on the Services. We will ask for your express consent to the updated Terms where we are legally required to do so, and our notice to you will explain how you can accept or reject the changes. If you do not agree with any of the updated Terms, you must stop using the Services. Unless otherwise required by law, the updated Terms are effective as of the day of posting.

(b) The Services. CloudBud may change the Services at any time without notice to you. If you object to any changes to the Services, your sole recourse will be to cease using the Services. Continued use of the Services following the posting of any such changes will indicate your acknowledgment of such changes and satisfaction with the Services as modified. We also reserve the right to discontinue the Services, or any component of it, at any time without notice to you. We will not be liable to you or any third party should we exercise our right to modify or discontinue the Services.

(c) Paid subscriptions. Please note that if you are under paid-subscription services with us, in the event we change the price for the services which you have previously agreed to pay or if we substantially change the services you are paying for, we will also notify you of such changes as contemplated in Section 3(a) above. Any changes will become effective after your then-current subscription expires or terminates. If you do not agree with such changes and you communicate this to us in accordance with the notification, we will not automatically renew your subscription, even if you previously agreed to automatic renewal for payment.

(d) Executed Contract(s). If You have entered into a separately executed agreement for services with CloudBud (collectively and individually, “Contract”), such Contract shall supersede these Terms. If there is any conflict between these Terms and the Contract, the Contract will prevail. In cases where the Contract does not address specific provisions included in these Terms, these Terms will apply, supplementing the Contract.

You agree not to create an Account using a false identity or information. You agree that you shall not have more than one Account at any given time. You agree not to register for an Account on behalf of an individual other than Yourself or register for an Account on behalf of any group or entity unless you are authorized to bind such person, group, organization, or entity to these Terms. By registering another person, group, organization, or entity, you hereby represent that you are authorized to do so. You agree not to create an Account or use the Services if CloudBud has previously removed you or has been previously banned from any of the CloudBud properties.

(d) Account Management. When registering for the Services, You will choose a login (email) and password. You may use the Services or modify Your Content and data only through login and password. You are entirely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of Your password and for any and all activities which occur using Your credentials and/or under your Account.

If you use a username and password that CloudBud considers insecure or inappropriate, CloudBud will be entitled to require this to be changed and/or terminate your Account. CloudBud reserves the right to remove or reclaim any usernames at any time and for any reason, including but not limited to claims by a third party that a username violates the third party’s rights. It is also Your responsibility to make sure that Our domain(s) (including “[cloudbud.com](http://cloudbud.com)”) are not included in any spam block list used by You or Your mail provider. You are required to perform all necessary security configuration and management tasks (1) for Your site(s) and all domains, web pages, or IP addresses which You are hosting through the Services and (2) to protect Your Content (defined below) and data, including that of Your customers and/or end users hosted through the Services. You are responsible for managing updates and security patches, any application software or utilities installed, any files accessible via Your site(s), and the configuration of any CloudBud-provided security utilities.

# **Services**

At the time of initial registration, You will select from the list of available Services the service plan(s) to which You wish to subscribe (each a “Subscription”). All Subscriptions to Services are subject to formal acceptance by CloudBud. Your Subscription to the Services will be deemed accepted by CloudBud when CloudBud delivers a confirmation of the Subscription to You. CloudBud reserves the right to refuse to provide You with any Service for any reason. Notwithstanding Our Uptime Guarantee, CloudBud reserves the right to interrupt access to the Services to perform regular and emergency maintenance as needed. You may order additional Services at any time, provided that You agree to pay the then-current fees for such additional Services. All additional services shall be considered "Services" hereunder. All Services provided are subject to availability and these Terms.

For as long as you agree to these Terms and abide by them, you may use the Services. These Terms apply to all Service Users, including Visitors and Registered Users, who contribute to User Content. The Services are licensed, not sold, to you.

(a) Grant of a Limited License. Copyright laws protect the Services throughout the world. Subject to your agreement and continuing compliance with these Terms and any other relevant CloudBud policies, CloudBud grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable limited license subject to the limitations below to use the Services and/or download, and use a copy of any Apps or client-software on a device or computer that you own or control and to run such copy solely for your own internal business or individual purposes only. You agree not to use the Services for any other purpose.

(b) Restrictions. You may not: (i) remove any copyright, trademark, or other proprietary notices from any portion of the Services; (ii) reproduce, modify, prepare derivative works based upon, distribute, license, lease, sell, resell, transfer, publicly display, publicly perform, transmit, stream, broadcast or otherwise exploit the Services except as expressly permitted by CloudBud; (iii) decompile, reverse engineer or disassemble the Services except as may be permitted by applicable law; (iv) link to, mirror or frame any portion of the Services except as expressly permitted by CloudBud; (v) cause or launch any programs or scripts for the purpose of scraping, indexing, surveying, or otherwise data mining any portion of the Services or unduly burdening or hindering the operation and/or functionality of any aspect of the Services; or (vi) attempt to gain unauthorized access to or impair any aspect of the Services or its related systems or networks.

# **Subscriptions and Cancellations**

(a) Subscriptions. Your Subscription or commencement of the Services shall begin upon confirmation to You and receipt of lawful funds, whichever comes earlier. You choose the Subscription's initial term length, which shall be indicated when subscribing to Our Services. The Subscription may not be terminated by You during the Initial Term (and any renewals thereof) except in the event of a breach by CloudBud. After the Initial Term, the Subscription shall automatically renew for successive terms, equal in length to the Initial Term, unless terminated or canceled by either party as provided herein.

(b) Pricing. Subject to Section 3(c), CloudBud reserves the right to change prices for paid Subscriptions at any time and does not provide price protection or refunds in the event of promotions or price decreases. Any pricing changes will become effective after your then-current Subscription expires or terminates. You understand that if We agree to provide Services to You in the future after your Subscription terminates for any reason, the amount You paid under any prior term or time period is not determinative of the amount You will pay should We provide Services to You again. It is Your responsibility to check Our Site for plan or price changes should You wish to take advantage of plan or price changes that may have occurred. CloudBud does not automatically update Your Subscription plan. All upgrades or downgrades will be performed at Your request and may include modification of Fees (defined in Section 7(a)) or require reinitiating service with Us.

(c) Automatic Renewal Terms: To facilitate the continuity of the Services to you, each paid Subscription contains automatic renewal terms. CloudBud will automatically renew your paid Subscription as per the Subscription period of your choosing (each a “Subscription Term”) on the anniversary of that date that CloudBud first charges your Account for the first Subscription fee, and, as authorized by you during the Subscription sign-up process, CloudBud will charge your Account with the applicable Subscription fee and any sales or similar taxes that may be imposed on your Subscription fee payment (unless you cancel prior to the anniversary date). Each Subscription renewal period is for the same Subscription Term as the prior one unless otherwise agreed between you and CloudBud. IF YOU CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION, YOUR ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE SERVICES WILL BE SHUT OFF ONCE YOUR THEN-CURRENT SUBSCRIPTION TERM EXPIRES.

CloudBud reserves the right to modify pricing at any time (but not the price in effect for your then-current Subscription Term) upon advance notice to you. If you have not canceled your Subscription or turned off the auto-renew function within the specified time after receiving notice of a price change, your Subscription will auto-renew at the price indicated in your notice.

(d) CANCELLATION TERMS: YOU MAY CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION AT ANY TIME, AND SUCH CANCELLATION SHALL BECOME EFFECTIVE UPON EXPIRATION OF YOUR THEN-CURRENT SUBSCRIPTION TERM. You agree and understand that you will be charged Subscription fees until the expiration of your then-current Subscription Term. SUBSCRIPTION FEES WILL NOT BE REFUNDED, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, SUBJECT TO APPLICABLE LAW. You will not be eligible for a prorated refund of any portion of the Subscription fees paid for any unused days of the then-current Subscription Term. If you have any problems or concerns with your cancellation, please contact us at [support@cloudbud.com](mailto:support@cloudbud.com) for assistance.

# **Payments**

(a) If you purchase any Services that we offer for a fee, either on a one-time or on a Subscription basis (collectively “Fees”), you agree and consent to CloudBud’s use of third-party payment providers for billing and processing online payments (see below), and you agree to pay the applicable Fees for the Services (including, without limitation, periodic fees for Subscriptions) as they become due, plus all related taxes, and to reimburse us for all collection costs and interest for any overdue amounts. Unless separately negotiated by You and Us and confirmed by a separate written agreement, the initial and recurring Fees for the Services selected by You shall be as provided in the initial online order form. All set-up fees and special programming fees are non-refundable. Unless otherwise indicated, we may invoice Fees for Services in advance. Failure to make payment of Fees for Services when due may result in the suspension or termination of Services.

(b) Services are billed on an automatic, auto-renewal, and recurring basis unless and until you follow CloudBud's cancellation procedure outlined in this Agreement. Your obligation to pay fees continues through the end of the Subscription Term (defined in Section 6(c)). Our Subscriptions may be subject to usage limits. You agree and understand that we verify the use of the Service periodically. If, as part of a routine verification process, we determine that Usage exceeds the current amount of usage limits purchased, we reserve the right to invoice you for the additional use. We may contact you to discuss your current plan and other options available to you. You agree to upgrade to a higher usage plan if necessary.

(c) At the time of registration, You must select a payment method. By providing a payment method, You expressly authorize CloudBud to charge said payment method at regular intervals subject to Your particular Subscription. CloudBud reserves the right to contract with a third party to process all payments. Such third parties may impose additional terms and conditions governing payment processing. If You do not pay all Fees when due, Your account will be deemed past due. For any past due Fees, CloudBud reserves the right to charge You interest at ten percent (10%) per month of the unpaid amount until paid.

(d) You agree to pay any and all taxes, including personal property, value-added, or sales taxes, resulting from Your use of the Services. CloudBud is not responsible for any bank fees incurred by You due to Your use of check cards, automatic payment services, insufficient funds, and any and all other fees your financial institution may impose due to Your use of the Services. If CloudBud should receive less than full payment of the Fees due to taxes, bank charges, transfer fees, or the like, CloudBud will invoice You for the difference between the payment received and the Fees due. You also agree to pay all attorney and collection fees arising from CloudBud's efforts to collect any past due Fees.

(e) If you cancel any Service before the expiration of the pre-paid Fees, You understand and agree that CloudBud, at its sole discretion, may not issue You any refund whatsoever, including but not limited to any remaining pre-paid Fees, set-up Fees, and/or special programming Fees. Any refunds, if any, will be refunded to the original payment method only.

(f) If you do not pay on time or if CloudBud cannot charge your payment method for any reason, CloudBud reserves the right to either suspend or terminate your Subscription, access to the Services, and/or Account and terminate these Terms.

(g) Coupons and Discount Codes. From time to time, CloudBud may offer coupons or other discount codes which may be used when signing up for Services with Us. Coupons and discount codes are for first-time customers of CloudBud only and must be used at the time of Your initial purchase with Us – they may not be applied after the commencement of the Services. Unless expressly provided, such coupons and discount codes may not be used to upgrade your account. Any account We deem to be attempting unauthorized coupon or discount code use may be subject to Termination for Cause (see Section 8).

# **Termination**

(a) CloudBud may terminate your Subscription at its sole discretion at any time for any reason or no reason ("Termination without Cause"). In such a case, CloudBud will provide you thirty (30) days' written notice before the discontinuation of Services. If CloudBud cancels your Subscription pursuant to any of the terms outlined in these Terms, except for Termination without Cause, CloudBud shall not refund to You any fees paid or prepaid in advance of such cancellation, and You shall be obligated to pay all fees, and charges accrued before the effectiveness of such cancellation. In the event that CloudBud terminates the Agreement for cause, all prepaid Fees will be forfeited and are not refundable. The termination of your Subscription does not relieve You of Your obligation to pay any Fees accrued or payable to CloudBud prior to the effective date of termination of your Subscription.

(b) In addition to CloudBud's right to terminate your Subscription provided elsewhere in these Terms, CloudBud may terminate your Subscription effective immediately if, based on CloudBud's sole judgment, it determines that You or any of Your end users: (i) have breached the Acceptable Use Policy ("AUP"), (ii) have infringed or violated any intellectual property right or privacy or publicity right of a third party, (iii) have not complied with any applicable law, statute or regulation, or (iv) have uploaded, published or disseminated any images, text, graphics, code or video which CloudBud considers illegal or high risk, in its discretion, or (v) breached these Terms. Nothing contained in these Terms is intended to, or shall, impose any duty or obligation upon CloudBud to monitor or review Your Content (defined in Section 12) or the content of Your end users at any time. You remain solely responsible for Your Content and any liability generated therefrom.

(c) The termination of your Subscription will end Your access to the Services and Your license to the Materials. CloudBud shall not be liable to You or to any third party for termination of the Services permitted under these Terms. Upon termination of your Subscription, CloudBud reserves the right to maintain copies of Your data files and records for archival purposes but does not undertake any obligation to do so. CloudBud reserves the right to impose an early termination charge for all Services terminated before the last day of the billing cycle.

(d) If either party cancels or terminates your Subscription for any reason, You shall be solely responsible for making all necessary arrangements for securing a replacement service provider and timely moving all electronic data, graphics, images, video, or text to the new service provider.

(e) CloudBud will not have any liability whatsoever to you for any suspension or termination, including for deletion of Content. All provisions of the Terms, which by their nature should survive, shall survive termination of the Service, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, and limitation of liability. You may close your Account by using the feature provided in the Services or, in the alternative, by emailing us at [support@cloudbud.com](mailto:support@cloudbud.com). We will proceed to close your Account and send you an email confirmation.

# **Acceptable Use Policy**

To use our Services, you agree to and warrant that you will comply at all times with our Acceptable Use Policy (“AUP”), as these may be amended from time to time, which regulate prohibited and/or acceptable practices relating to the use of our Services, including limitations on User Content, prohibited activities, system abuse, and security. If you disagree with our Policies, you must discontinue use of the Service. The Policies are hereby incorporated by reference.

# **Copyright Infringement and DMCA Notices**

CloudBud does not permit copyright-infringing activities and infringing intellectual property rights on the Services. Pursuant to the safe-harbor provisions provided by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (“DMCA”), CloudBud will remove User Content if properly notified that such User Content infringes on another's intellectual property rights. CloudBud reserves the right to remove User Content without prior notice.

# **User Content**

## **Content**

(a) You are responsible for the information, text, opinions, messages, comments, audiovisual works, motion pictures, photographs, animation, videos, graphics, sounds, music, software, Apps, and any other content or material that You or your end users submit, upload, post, host, store, or otherwise make available (“Make Available”) on or through the Services (collectively, “Your Content,” “Content” or “User Content”). You may not Make Available on the Services any material protected by copyright, trademark, or any other proprietary right without the express permission of the owner of such copyright, trademark, or other proprietary right owned by a third party, and the burden of determining whether any such right protects any material is on you. You shall be solely liable for any damage resulting from any infringement of copyrights, trademarks, proprietary rights, violation of contract, privacy or publicity rights, or any other harm resulting from any User Content you make or submit. As between you and us, you own your User Content, and you have complete responsibility for all User Content you make or submit, including its legality, reliability, and appropriateness, while using the Services. You hereby grant CloudBud a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, fully paid-up, worldwide license (including the right to sublicense through multiple tiers) to use, reproduce, process, adapt, publicly perform, publicly display, modify, prepare derivative works, publish, transmit and distribute each of your User Content, or any portion thereof, in any form, medium or distribution method now known or hereafter existing, known or developed, and otherwise use and commercialize the User Content in any way that CloudBud deems appropriate, without any further consent, notice and/or compensation to you or to any third parties, for purposes of providing the Services to you.

(b) CloudBud will not actively monitor Content being hosted by CloudBud, although CloudBud, at its sole discretion, may elect to monitor its network electronically and may disclose any content or records concerning Your Account as necessary to satisfy any law, regulation, or other governmental request or to operate our network and protect any of our customers adequately. CloudBud will investigate complaints about violating a third-party right or the AUP. CloudBud will cooperate with those attempting to minimize Internet abuse and reserves the right to institute "filters" or other mechanisms for that purpose. CloudBud will cooperate with law enforcement authorities and reserves the right to notify such authorities if it suspects that You or any of Your end users are engaged in illegal activities. Nothing contained in this Section, or anywhere in these Terms, is intended to bestow any rights on any third party, and no third party shall be entitled to enforce any terms of these Terms between us, the parties.

(c) You acknowledge and expressly agree that CloudBud will not be liable to You or any of Your end users for any action CloudBud takes to remove or restrict access to the Services for any alleged violation of the AUP, or exercising its rights under the DMCA.

(d) CloudBud may, at its sole discretion, immediately terminate Your Account and access to the Services, and terminate these Terms for cause, if Your conduct violates our Policies (See Section 10) or if any of Your end users' or downstream customers' conduct violate such Policies. We respect the intellectual property rights of all parties and have adopted a policy regarding the termination of repeat copyright infringers under the DMCA (See Section 9).
