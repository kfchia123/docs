These terms of use (the “Terms”) are a legal contract between CloudBud, a trading name of BYIO Singapore Pte. Ltd., and “you” (“Customer,” “your,” or “User”). The Terms explain how you are permitted to use the services provided by and through our platform and website(s) (main url located at [cloudbud.com](http://cloudbud.com)) as well as all of our associated internet and online properties (either linked by CloudBud and/or affiliated companies) and any software that CloudBud provides to you for download or use, including in your mobile devices (collectively, our “App(s)”) (all of these virtual properties, software and mobile applications, collectively, the “Site”). These Terms also govern your use of all the text, data, information, software, graphics, proprietary content, and more (all of which we refer to as “Materials”) that we and/or our affiliates may make available to you, as well as any services we may provide through this Site). Collectively, the Site, the Materials, and the services provided therein are referred to as the “Services.”

# **Contractual Relationship**

By using the Services, you represent and warrant that you are of age under the laws of your jurisdiction and/or lawfully able to enter into contracts. If you are not legally able to enter into contracts, you may not use the Services at any time or in any manner or submit any information to CloudBud or the Services.

If you enter these Terms on behalf of a business entity or organization, you represent and warrant that you have the legal authority and capacity to bind such a business entity or organization. If you are not authorized nor deemed by law to have such authority, you assume sole personal liability for the obligations set out in these Terms.

# **Privacy**

Please review our privacy policy (the “Privacy Policy”) which explains how we use the information you submit to CloudBud. The Privacy Policy is hereby incorporated by reference.

# **Modifications**

(a) These Terms. CloudBud can change, update, add, or remove provisions of these Terms at any time by posting the updated Terms on the Site and by providing a notice on the Services. We will ask for your express consent to the updated Terms where we are legally required to do so, and our notice to you will explain how you can accept or reject the changes. If you do not agree with any of the updated Terms, you must stop using the Services. Unless otherwise required by law, the updated Terms are effective as of the day of posting.

(b) The Services. CloudBud may change the Services at any time without notice to you. If you object to any changes to the Services, your sole recourse will be to cease using the Services. Continued use of the Services following the posting of any such changes will indicate your acknowledgment of such changes and satisfaction with the Services as modified. We also reserve the right to discontinue the Services, or any component of it, at any time without notice to you. We will not be liable to you or any third party should we exercise our right to modify or discontinue the Services.

(c) Paid subscriptions. Please note that if you are under paid-subscription services with us, in the event we change the price for the services which you have previously agreed to pay or if we substantially change the services you are paying for, we will also notify you of such changes as contemplated in Section 3(a) above. Any changes will become effective after your then-current subscription expires or terminates. If you do not agree with such changes and you communicate this to us in accordance with the notification, we will not automatically renew your subscription, even if you previously agreed to automatic renewal for payment.

(d) Executed Contract(s). If You have entered into a separately executed agreement for services with CloudBud (collectively and individually, “Contract”), such Contract shall supersede these Terms. If there is any conflict between these Terms and the Contract, the Contract will prevail. In cases where the Contract does not address specific provisions included in these Terms, these Terms will apply, supplementing the Contract.

# **Users**

(a) Visitors. Visitors may browse the Site in accordance with these Terms but will not have full access to the Services without first becoming “Registered Users.”

(b) Registered Users and Accounts. To access certain features of the Services, you will be required to become a Registered User. A “Registered User” is a User who has registered an account with us (your “Account”). As a Registered User, you choose what information you may make public or showcase. By registering as a User, you represent that you are not barred from using the Services under these Terms, the laws of the United States of America, your place of residence, or any other applicable jurisdiction.

In registering for the Services, you agree to (i) provide true, accurate, current, and complete information about yourself as prompted by the Service’s registration form (the “Registration Data”); and (ii) maintain and promptly update the Registration Data to keep it true, accurate, current and complete. You agree that all notices and communications between Us will be sent to the email address You provide. If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current, or incomplete, or CloudBud has reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is untrue, inaccurate, not current, or incomplete, CloudBud has the right to suspend or terminate your Account and refuse any and all current or future use of the Services (or any portion thereof) for breach. You agree not to create an Account using a false identity or information. You agree that you shall not have more than one Account at any given time. You agree not to register for an Account on behalf of an individual other than Yourself or register for an Account on behalf of any group or entity unless you are authorized to bind such person, group, organization, or entity to these Terms. By registering another person, group, organization, or entity, you hereby represent that you are authorized to do so. You agree not to create an Account or use the Services if CloudBud has previously removed you or has been previously banned from any of the CloudBud properties.

(d) Account Management. When registering for the Services, You will choose a login (email) and password. You may use the Services or modify Your Content and data only through login and password. You are entirely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of Your password and for any and all activities which occur using Your credentials and/or under your Account. CloudBud reserves the right to establish an Account verification process to verify the account and/or any information provided. You agree to immediately notify Us of any unauthorized use of Your Account or any other breach of security known to (or reasonably suspected by) You at [support@cloudbud.com](mailto:support@cloudbud.com). CloudBud shall be entitled to monitor your username and password and, at its discretion, require you to change it. If you use a username and password that CloudBud considers insecure or inappropriate, CloudBud will be entitled to require this to be changed and/or terminate your Account. CloudBud reserves the right to remove or reclaim any usernames at any time and for any reason, including but not limited to claims by a third party that a username violates the third party’s rights. It is also Your responsibility to make sure that Our domain(s) (including “[cloudbud.com](http://cloudbud.com)”) are not included in any spam block list used by You or Your mail provider. You are required to perform all necessary security configuration and management tasks (1) for Your site(s) and all domains, web pages, or IP addresses which You are hosting through the Services and (2) to protect Your Content (defined below) and data, including that of Your customers and/or end users hosted through the Services. You are responsible for managing updates and security patches, any application software or utilities installed, any files accessible via Your site(s), and the configuration of any CloudBud-provided security utilities.

# **Services**

At the time of initial registration, You will select from the list of available Services the service plan(s) to which You wish to subscribe (each a “Subscription”).

CloudBud reserves the right to refuse to provide You with any Service for any reason. Notwithstanding Our Uptime Guarantee, CloudBud reserves the right to interrupt access to the Services to perform regular and emergency maintenance as needed.
