title: "What is a Snapshot and how to create one?"
---

A Snapshot is essentially a backup of a Virtual Private Server (VPS) at a specific point in time. It captures the exact state of the VPS, including its operating system, installed applications, files, settings, and any running processes at the moment the snapshot is taken.

This snapshot can be used for:

1. Backup and Recovery: If something goes wrong with the VPS (like data loss, software failure, or security breach), you can restore the VPS to the exact state it was in when the snapshot was taken. This is usually recommended before you do a system upgrade or upgrade any of your installed application such as Wordpress.
2. Testing and Development: Developers often use snapshots to create a safe testing environment. They can take a snapshot before making significant changes or updates, then restore the snapshot if something breaks.

Snapshots are typically used as a way to quickly and efficiently create backups or restore to a previous working state without needing to rebuild the server from scratch.

The good news is, CloudBud gives you 1 free Snapshot for every VPS subscribed. Other competitor charges you for Snapshot, if any is such feature is available.

**Taking a Snapshot**

In the Product details page of your selected product to do Snapshot, click on Snapshots button.
